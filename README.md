# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go (dsaGo)

A comprehensive educational implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms in Go. This project serves as both a learning resource and a practical reference, offering thoroughly documented implementations with complexity analysis and practical examples.

<details>
<summary>üéØ Project Overview</summary>

We have created this repository to provide clear, educational implementations of core computer science concepts in Go. Every implementation includes detailed documentation that explains not just how the code works, but why specific design decisions were made.

Understanding data structures and algorithms is fundamental to computer science for several important reasons:

The project helps developers master efficient programming by providing:

- Deep understanding of algorithmic complexity and optimization
- Practical examples of solving complex programming challenges
- Interview preparation with real-world implementations
- Hands-on experience with fundamental CS concepts

Each implementation focuses on clarity and educational value while maintaining production-quality code standards.

<summary>üèóÔ∏è Core Components</summary>

Our implementations are organized into three main categories:

### Data Structures

Each data structure implementation includes complexity analysis, usage patterns, and practical applications.

#### Linked Lists

We provide both singly and doubly linked list implementations to demonstrate:

- Node-based data structure fundamentals
- Pointer manipulation in Go
- List traversal and modification algorithms
- Performance characteristics comparison with arrays

Complexity Analysis:

- Insertion: O(1) at head, O(n) at arbitrary position
- Deletion: O(1) with node reference, O(n) by value
- Search: O(n) linear time

#### Stack and Queue

Our implementations use slices to demonstrate:

- LIFO (Stack) and FIFO (Queue) principles
- Efficient memory management
- Common application patterns

Both structures maintain O(1) complexity for core operations:

- Push/Enqueue
- Pop/Dequeue
- Peek

#### Binary Search Trees

Our BST implementation showcases:

- Tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
- Recursive problem-solving techniques
- Self-balancing mechanisms
- Efficient searching in ordered data sets

#### Hash Tables

The hash table implementation demonstrates:

- Sophisticated hash function design
- Multiple collision resolution strategies
- Dynamic resizing algorithms
- Space-time trade-off considerations

### Searching Algorithms

Both our searching implementations include detailed performance analysis and use case recommendations.

Linear Search:

- Implementation demonstrates the baseline searching algorithm
- Useful for small or unsorted datasets
- O(n) time complexity with in-depth analysis
- Best practices for sequential search implementation

Binary Search:

- Demonstrates divide-and-conquer methodology
- Requires sorted input with explanation of why
- O(log n) time complexity with proof
- Implementation includes robust error handling

### Sorting Algorithms

Each sorting algorithm includes:

- Complete complexity analysis for all cases
- Memory usage patterns and optimization
- Comparative analysis with other sorting methods
- Real-world application scenarios

<summary>üöÄ Getting Started</summary>

### Prerequisites

Your development environment should have:

- Go 1.16 or higher (for modern language features)
- Make (optional, for build automation)
- Git (for version control)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsaGo.git
cd dsaGo
```

2. Initialize the module

```bash
make init
```

### Running the Examples

The project provides multiple ways to explore and understand the implementations. Each command is designed to showcase different aspects of the codebase:

1. Run all demonstrations:

```bash
make run
```

This will execute a comprehensive demonstration of all implemented algorithms and data structures, providing detailed output at each step.

2. Run a specific demonstration:

```bash
make run-sort    # Demonstrates all sorting algorithms
make run-search  # Demonstrates search implementations
make run-ds      # Showcases data structure operations
```

Each category-specific command provides focused demonstrations with detailed performance metrics and comparison data.

3. Build executables:

```bash
make build
```

Creates an optimized binary that you can distribute or run later.

4. Clean up build artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

Removes generated files and binaries for a clean development environment.

### Understanding the Output

When running demonstrations, you'll see:

- Step-by-step execution explanations with detailed context
- Performance metrics for each operation, including time and space analysis
- Comparative analysis between different algorithmic approaches
- Visual representations of data structures where applicable
- Runtime complexity indicators at key points of execution

### Example Usage

Here's a typical workflow for exploring the implementations:

1. Start with a full demonstration to see all components in action:

```bash
make run
```

2. Explore specific algorithms of interest for deeper understanding:

```bash
make run-sort
```

3. Experiment with different input sizes to understand scaling:

```bash
make run-sort SIZE=1000
```

4. Generate comprehensive performance reports:

```bash
make benchmark
```
